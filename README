This is a presentation about the Play framework, created in the Play Framework
=================================

The presentation was created for Harvrad's Institute of Quantitative Social Science (IQSS).

It focuses on the interesting parts of Play, especially in comparison to JEE (which also have interesting parts. You don't get to be that popular for being entirly bad, mind you).

To run this, you need to install play or activator:
